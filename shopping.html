         Along Cayuga Street, you can visit 60 different handcrafting artisans. Items that will be sold include jewelry, ceramics, home decor, body care, specialty gifts, unique sculpture, clothing, and much more. Many of these items are things that young children may need or want, and many of the items sold are suited for adults as well. Shopping at AppleFest provides parents with another source of entertainment, enhancing the overall experience for the family.
