        <p>The 34th Annual Great Downtown Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival by Presented
          Tompkins Trust Company is set to take place September 30 - October 2, 2016.
          The 2016 Apple Harvest Festival hosts plenty of apples, local produce,
          fresh baked goods, family entertainment at every turn, games, rides, prizes
          and live performances on two stages. Apple Harvest Festival is a great
          introduction to the rich farm and artist community of Ithaca.  First time
          visitors can witness a variety of wonderful local entertainment while
          also visiting the historical outdoor pedestrian shopping mall,
          The Ithaca Commons.  The pedestrian mall is the epicenter of the festival
          and the gateway to a nostalgic journey to harvest season fun.</p>
